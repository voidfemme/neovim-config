# Rose Proctor's Neovim Configuration

This neovim config is mostly copied from https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide

If you somehow find this page and don't know about Chris@Machine's neovim set-up
series on Youtube, I highly recommend it: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ

## To-Do
- [ ] research why my syntax highlighting is breaking
    - [ ] research mason, null-ls, lsp, language servers, treesitter, etc.
    - [ ] include important details in this readme so that I can reference how
          they interact with each other.

## Mason 
## null-ls
